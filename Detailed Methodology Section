A. How core features were implemented
- The features in this program (i.e. operatons, calculation history)
  were implemented using pre-defined functioms, user-defined functions
  and libraries, specifically the Math Library in Python.

B. Technologies used (with justification)
- Python Code (Justification: Code Uses Python Syntax and Formatting suitable
  for Grade 8 Students)
- Math Library (Justification: The Math Library was used for Complex Operations
  like Logarithms)

C. Backend–frontend communication (if applicable)
- For ease of maintenance and debugging of our Mathematical Calculator 
  we've chosen to keep the frontend and backend separated. 
- The backend takes care of all calculations (i.e. Python functions), 
  while the frontend controls the input and output user interface.

D. Key design decisions or trade-off
- Make the program design simple and not complex to use.
- Made sure that the code is clean to read by ensuring proper spacing.
- Keep the data flow smooth.
- One critical design consideration will be how effectively can frontend communicate with backend and vice versa. 
- Make sure there is a secure input and output of the users.

E. Reference to ethical considerations in programming choices (e.g., user privacy, accessibility)
- We made sure that no personal/private information shall be given by
  the user and that no general information is permanently stored in
  the computer. Additionally, the program is made to be easily readable
  for the user by ensuring proper spacing and grammar.
