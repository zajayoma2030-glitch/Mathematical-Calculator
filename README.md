# Project Title Mathematical Calculator

## Project Description
	This is  a simple math calculator (with a twist) program that solves the problem of users needing a fast and easy way to calculate basic (and some advanced) arithmetic operations without manual calculation. 

## Features Description
	- Allows users to enter two or more numbers
	– Enables the user to find the difference between two numbers
	– Enables the user to multiply two or more real numbers and displays the product
	– Divides one number by another and shows the quotient
	- Enables the program to solve exponential and logarithmic equations
	– Clearer and more user-friendly messages and prompts for better usability
	- Enables the user to perform another operation infinitely many times
	- Enables the user to see their previous performed calculations

## How to Run the Program
	1. Make sure you have Python installed.
	2. Download the file ‘mathemical_calculator.py’.
	3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
	4. Execute your program by pressing F5 or clicking “Run”.
	5. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter students' names and grades.

## Example Output
	WELCOME TO THE MATHEMATICAL CALCULATOR!
	Addition - 1
	Subtraction - 2
	Multiplication - 3
	Division - 4
	Exponentation - 5
	Logarithmic - 6

	Please Pick an Operation:4

	Please enter your first number:3
	Please enter your second number:1
	The quotient is: 3.0 with a remainder of: 0.0
	Do you want to learn more about the quotient and remainder? (Yes/No)Yes
	Did you know that the number 3.0 is prime and also is odd?
	On the other hand, the number 0.0 is neither prime nor composite and also is even.

	Do you want to perform another operation? (Yes/No)Yes
