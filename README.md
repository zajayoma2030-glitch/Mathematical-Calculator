# Project Title Mathematical Calculator

## Project Description
	This is  a simple math calculator (with a twist) program that solves the problem of users needing a fast and easy way to calculate basic (and some advanced) arithmetic operations without manual calculation. 

## Features Description
	- Allows users to enter two or more numbers
	– Enables the user to find the difference between two numbers
	– Enables the user to multiply two or more real numbers and displays the product
	– Divides one number by another and shows the quotient
	- Enables the program to solve exponential and logarithmic equations
	– Clearer and more user-friendly messages and prompts for better usability
	- Enables the user to perform another operation infinitely many times
	- Enables the user to see their previous performed calculations
